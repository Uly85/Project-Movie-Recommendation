American Psycho,"Mary Harron's sleekly brilliant screen adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis's notorious 1991 novel pares away most of the book's gore to portray the main character's homicidal butchery as a high-gloss fantasy. The movie's chic blend of satire, comedy and horror is anchored in a star-making performance by Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman, a fashion-obsessed late-80's Wall Street hotshot who goes on a killing spree. Reese Witherspoon, Chloe Sevigny, Samantha Mathis and Cara Seymour give dazzling cameo performances as the unfortunate women in his life. The movie's message about a soulless surface-obsessed society still applies. &#151; Stephen Holden",NYT

Kill Bill Vol. 1,"Quentin Tarantino's fourth movie, his first in six years, is astonishingly violent, intermittently fascinating and sometimes tedious. This may be the picture's most serious flaw, since it comes from a man whose worship of action movies from all over the world (but especially Asia) is evident in every frame. Also evident is his obsession with Uma Thurman: by far the most emotionally charged relationship in the movie is the one between the director and his star, who functions as his muse, idol, alter ego and fetish object. Her character, the Bride, is a former assassin whose former lover (that would be Bill) tried to kill her on her wedding day. In this film, the first installment in a two-part revenge epic, the Bride wakes up from a 4-year coma and goes after the hired swords and guns who attacked her. Most of the exposition has been left for Volume Two; this one is an anthology of increasingly violent sequences, some sickening, some rather thrilling, that culminates in a Tokyo nightclub bloodbath  during which Lucy Liu, playing a petite yakuza boss, shows off her Japanese, and also (quite literally) her brains. — A. O. Scott",NYT
Amores Perros,"When a director shifts gears as often as does Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, the man behind the emotionally rich debut film &quot;Amores Perros,&quot; you may wonder if he knows what he wants. He does, and this film is satisfying in many ways. He is unashamed to immerse this tough-minded, episodic film noir in freshets of melodrama. Significantly, he knows the minute difference between being unashamed and being shameless, and because he knows how to keep things hopping   —   working from an intricate script by Guillermo Arrianga that has a novelistic texture   —   we watch a man with immaculate control of the medium. — Elvis Mitchell",NYT
The Sixth Sense,"What starts out as a horror movie about a troubled 8-year-old boy (Haley Joel Osment) who claims to see dead people, and the child psychologist (Bruce Willis) determined to cure him, eventually turns into New Age mush (think ''What Dreams May Come'' and ''Simon Birch''). When you trace the plot backward after its big secret is revealed, the story doesn't begin to add up. Mr. Willis gives his usual smirking one-note performance. What empathy the movie generates comes from Mr. Osment's intense portrayal of the tormented child. &#151; Stephen Holden",NYT
Fargo,"Car salesman sets up kidnapping. Coens' snowbound film noir, merry and macabre.",NYT
Every Which Way But Loose,"All over the place. And ever so folksy. Truck driver, promoter and orangutan.",NYT
The Enforcer,Dirty Harry stalks terrorists. Typical early Clint.,NYT
Wells Fargo,"Western with size, color and sweep galore. Bit too crammed for unity and depth. But a real eyeful.",NYT
Jurassic Park III,"Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), who barely escaped alive in the first &quot;Jurassic Park,&quot; returns in this film. He's the leader of an expedition that crash-lands on the dinosaurs' island, putting everyone at the mercy of the park's denizens. Even though this sequel ticks off all the conventions, the movie dashes like a one-track-mind raptor. It's speedy, light on its feet and louder than bombs; it's also a lot more fun than the previous &quot;Park&quot; excursions. Much of the talent behind the cameras has done survival-of-the-fittest films before (Joe Johnston's filmography includes &quot;Jumanji&quot;). And they seem determined to check off all the to-do notes necessary for a prehistoric exploitation picture: we're missing only Raquel Welch in a yummy fur bikini. — Elvis Mitchell

Personal Velocity,"Filmmakers looking to master the no-budget digital video film need look no further than &quot;Personal Velocity,&quot; where Ellen Kuras's cinematography wields delicacy and freshness. Ms. Kuras understands first and foremost that there's no point in trying to pretend that digital video is the same as film. Instead she uses the strengths of digital and wisely chooses to go smaller; she shoots the picture as if it were hand-painted, an intimacy that complements the writer and director Rebecca Miller's script and handling of her actors. The cumulative effect is that of watching misspent lives disintegrate before your eyes. Her canny accomplishment is a triumph, taking what could be dismissed as women's-picture material and giving it weight and heart. This is one of the finest pictures of the year because Ms. Miller's knowledge of her characters' insides is mirrored by the secure palette of Ms. Kuras's camera work. &#151; Elvis Mitchell",NYT
The Personals,"Though set in a Taipei whose modern gleam is perpetually cloaked in mist and smog, Chen Kuo-fu's film could take place in any city whose residents have purchased material comfort and personal freedom at the cost of loneliness and anomie. This mood of melancholy settles in slowly. For most of its duration, &quot;The Personals&quot; finds humor in the emotional drift and romantic dislocation of urban life. It's an anti-romantic comedy that resolves on a minor chord of grief. The premise is as simple as the execution is elegant. A young eye doctor named Du Jiazhen (Rene Liu) disguises her identity slightly (for most of the film she's addressed as Ms. Wu) and advertises for a suitable mate. What she describes as a &quot;momentary slip&quot; and a possible &quot;route to happiness&quot; turns into a kind of sociological experiment as she meets a succession of candidates in a local tea shop. &#151; A.

Madadayo,"In the course of his long career, Kurosawa, who died in 1998, made a number of great movies. His last film, ''Madadayo,'' released in Japan in 1993, lacks the narrative intensity of emotional range to be considered among his masterpieces, but within its own modest proportions it achieves a kind of perfection. The story is not much: a retired professor in postwar Tokyo lives out his twilight years in the glow of his former students' devotion and declares his unreadiness to say farewell to the life he lives with humor and gusto. But Kurosawa's absolute assurance as a filmmaker and his unabashed affection for his characters make ''Madadayo'' a richly, and in a way inexplicably, satisfying movie. &#151; A. O. Scott",NYT

The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra,"Written and directed in black and white by Larry Blamire, who also stars as the pipe-smoking scientist Dr. Paul Armstrong, &quot;The Lost Skeleton&quot; is a parody of such drive-in cheapies as Roger Corman's 1957 &quot;Not of This Earth&quot; (from which it seems to have inherited the world's least convincing space alien) and Ed Wood's ineluctable &quot;Plan 9 From Outer Space&quot; (1959), with its pie-plate flying saucers and oaken dialogue.  Mr. Blamire's scientist is one of a group of characters — including a pair of space aliens accompanied by their pet giant mutant — searching the woods around Lake Arrowhead for a mysterious elements called &quot;atmospherium.&quot;  The picture wisely avoids a broad, campy style in favor of straight-faced pastiche, but never breaks through into laugh-out-loud comedy.  The question remains:  Why work so hard to make something deliberately bad, when the world is hardly running a shortage of mediocre movies? — Dave Kehr",NYT
In Bruges,"In “In Bruges,” Brendan Gleeson, Colin Farrell and Ralph Fiennes have great fun rummaging around inside Martin McDonagh’s modest bag of tricks.",NYT
Mystic River,"Clint Eastwood's film, scrupulously faithful to the letter and sprit of Dennis Lehane's novel, has the gritty efficiency of superior crime fiction and the somber weight of tragedy. Set in working-class Irish Catholic Boston, this film revisits the themes of violence, honor and guilt that have haunted many of Mr. Eastwood's movies; it is among the most humane of his films, but also the most rigorously pessimistic. Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon and Sean Penn play Dave, Sean and Jimmy, boyhood friends who must revisit the traumas of their youth when Jimmy's daughter is murdered. Sean and his partner (Laurence Fishburne) must investigate the killing, which it appears Dave may have committed. The performances are first rate. Marcia Gay Harden, as Dave's wife, Celeste, and Laura Linney, as her cousin Annabeth, who is married to Jimmy, expand the film's emotional compass, allowing us to see how grief ripples through families and communities. Mr. Penn's volcanic, furiously disciplined performance is surely one of the best pieces of screen acting you'll see this year; it may even be one of the finest ever. — A. O. Scott",NYT
The Bourne Identity,"Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne, a C.I.A. superassassin suffering from amnesia, who is chased across Europe, in the company of a charming German waif (Franka Potente), by his employers. There are espionage writers who use the genre to explore the complexities of geopolitics, but Robert Ludlum, on whose novel this competent, enjoyable picture is based, was not one of them. At a time when thrillers are shadowed by real-world anxieties, the implausibility and irrelevance of this movie, which amusingly imagines the C.I.A. as a super-competent, virtually omniscient operation, comes as something of a relief. Mr. Damon handles his characters' existential crisis with fierce adroitness, and Doug Limans direction has an old-fashioned swiftness and efficiency.  &mdash; A. O. Scott",NYT
Nine Queens,"Fabián Bielinski's trickster of a film is the kind of movie that seduces you into becoming putty in its manipulative card-sharking hands and making you enjoy being taken in by its shameless contrivance. When the secrets of its preposterous plot are finally revealed, you don't mind the absurdity. What matters is that the plot makes internal sense as an elaborate self-enclosed contraption. This Argentine movie is the directorial debut of a filmmaker who appears to have steeped himself so thoroughly in Alfred Hitchcock and David Mamet that it's hard to imagine &quot;Nine Queens&quot; having been made without them leering metaphorically over his shoulder. The movie combines Hitchcock's winking tongue-in-cheek vision of a paranoid universe where everyone may be part of an elaborate conspiracy with Mr. Mamet's obsession with the finer points of gamesmanship and con artistry. — Stephen Holden",NYT

Mulholland Drive,"David Lynch's epic nightmare of Hollywood, which began life as an open-ended television series (like his &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;) and evolved into a movie, may be his masterpiece. A leisurely film noir that turns into a surreal montage, it is a portrait of Hollywood filtered through the director's personal iconography, which in many ways is more early 1960's than contemporary in mood. The story traces the loss of innocence of a dewy  Hollywood hopeful (Naomi Watts) who befriends a mysterious amnesia victim (Laura  Harring) searching for her identity. Their journey figuratively plunges them through the looking glass into a phantasmagoric dream world. — Stephen Holden",NYT

The humans don't have much to do in &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; but put the plot in motion and stand back to watch it work, a precarious position that eventually claims most of them.  Though Mr. Anderson does have an idea for creating a rooting interest, it's too far-fetched even for fantasy, and the film turns into a cold but occasionally impressive special-effects extravaganza. — Dave Kehr",NYT

Almost from the  beginning, the film's sugary and rancid strains work against each other. To put it another  way, &quot;Little Black Book&quot; would like to be a wised-up but still starry-eyed &quot;Working Girl&quot;  and a more acerbic &quot;Broadcast News.&quot; In trying to be both things at once, it can't hold a candle to either forerunner.

The Bourne Supremacy,"It may sound odd to call a chilly paranoid thriller entertainment comfort food. But in the wake of 9/11, this globetrotting post-cold war melodrama full of standard cloak-and-dagger intrigue has the reassuring aroma of a home-cooked meal. There are no jihads or terrorists in sight and no apocalyptic scenarios, only dirty little secrets, as spies, counterspies from Russia and America tangle in a grubby story involving oil, sold secrets, murders and cover-ups. In this sequel to &quot;The Bourne Identity,&quot; many of the major hands who created the first film have returned, including Matt Damon as Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), the C.I.A.-trained assassin who can't remember his name or exactly why he's being hunted by everybody. As before, he spends almost the entire movie on the run. The movie reminds you that rhythms of film editing and collage making have allowed Hollywood to make the chase movie a surefire format. Plot and character ultimately don't matter much in a movie that's all about building and sustaining a mood in which visceral and emotional rhythms are blended into a high-gloss thrill ride. — Stephen Holden",NYT
Training Day,"Denzel Washington plays Detective Alonzo Harris, the Machiavellian figure in this intermittently successful police drama. Alonzo is the worst example a young officer could ever have to learn from. He is the teacher to Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke), who has just been assigned to undercover duties. When the picture dwells on dueling ambitions –  Jake's striving for  permanent assignment to undercover work and Alonzo's constant conning of his rookie partner – you lean in to listen. But eventually &quot;Training Day,&quot; despite Mr. Washington's virtuoso performance, becomes a glib potboiler torn from today's screaming headlines. – Elvis Mitchell

The film, however, makes one thing abundantly clear. American musical comedy as we know it wouldn't exist without the precedent of Yiddish theater, whose jolly, fun-for-fun's-sake communal spirit goes to the essence of Broadway. — Stephen Holden",NYT

Oddly, the film backs away from its fantasy premise and turns into a typical European workplace drama, as the two women, having found jobs in an American-style supermarket, get involved in labor issues.   The picture is at once painfully derivative and maddeningly overplotted. &#151; Dave Kehr",NYT
101 Reykjavik,"Baltasar Kormakur's cagey, wafer-thin Icelandic comedy brims with surliness, from Hlynur, its remorseless, do-nothing protagonist, to its score by Damon Albarn of Blur and Einar Orn Benediktsson of the Sugarcubes. Hlynur is nearly 30 and talks a wry game about being unwanted and unemployable when he just doesn't want to expend the effort it takes to leave his mother's house. When he does get out, it is to perform activities that are sure to upset people and bring a disdainful smirk to his face. So, when Lola (Victoria Abril) comes to stay with his mother, Hlynur finds enough energy to stumble into a clinch with her. The movie feels as though it is not about much, but it is so well acted that the lassitude becomes a part of the atmosphere. - Elvis Mitchell

Traffic,"Not since &quot;Nashville&quot; or maybe even &quot;The Godfather&quot; has Hollywood turned out an epic as resonant as Steven Soderbergh's densely layered study of the Mexican drug trade and its devastating impact on the United States. In weaving together multiple stories, this intricate thriller, adapted from a British mini-series, jumps from Tijuana to Washington to San Diego to suburban Ohio. Michael Douglas is the new American drug czar, Catherine Zeta-Jones the ruthless wife of a busted drug lord and Benicio Del Toro a Mexican policeman. Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman are a team of government agents whose bust of a cynical midlevel dealer (Miguel Ferrer) precipitates much of the drama. Shot with hand-held cameras, &quot;Traffic&quot; builds into a profound and gloomy meditation on greed, violence and contemporary ennui. — Stephen Holden",NYT
Human Traffic,Impotent young man on drug-alcohol binge. Blissfully hedonistic if sometimes exhausting.,NYT
Heavy Traffic,"Animated and live action. Cartoonist's seedy urban world. Liberating, arrogant, crude, tough, vulgar and full of wit.",NYT
Minority Report,"This atmospheric thriller is a muscular and dense exercise of skill and verve. (Ironically, this exercise may be the most adult film that Steven Spielberg has made in some time; it's about the bloody blurring of passion and violence — a compassionate noir.) In 2054, a law enforcement unit called Precrime exists to stop murders before they begin; three Precogs — beings who float in a nutrient-rich fluid — can predict when a crime will be committed and know the identity of the perpetrator. When the unit's chief, John Anderton, is accused of a crime he hasn't yet committed, he's soon on the run. Tom Cruise does as much sprinting in this picture as he has before in his entire filmography. The fluid bursts of quick-cut images seen on the monitors also show that Mr. Spielberg isn't about to be shown up by those quick-fingered, compulsively exhibitionistic upstarts like David Fincher. — Elvis Mitchell",NYT

Winter Sleepers,"Thrillingly virtuosic cinematic flourishes lend a steady charge of adrenaline to this drama about the tangled destinies of well-to-do German slackers in a picture-perfect skiing village. Made just before the jet-propelled pop fantasy ''Run Lola Run'' put Tom Tykwer on the short list of major international filmmakers, ''Winter Sleepers'' conveys the spiritual malaise afflicting the generation now in its late 20's and 30's. But like ''Run Lola Run,'' the movie is also about how human destiny has everything to do with split-second timing &#151; Stephen Holden
